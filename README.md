# Zero Data Rollup

Zero Data Rollup: it's a protocol with rollup security properties and off-chain data availability. 

How can it be possible?

We need to use an interactive protocol where the sender, receiver, and operator should cooperate to make a transaction.

# How it works

We introduce a coinId concept from [Plasma Cash](https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-cash-plasma-with-much-less-per-user-data-checking/1298). Every ether inside our protocol is a note - note with indivisible unique coinID which can be transferred holistically. In other words, it's a UTXO model with 1 input and 1 output per transaction.

When a user deposits a coin - the protocol creates a unique coinId. After that operator can send this note with coinID on L2 to the receiver. The receiver should get the Merkle path of the new state and sign the transaction. Otherwise, the transaction will create a withdrawal with this coinId to L1.

So every owner and past owner of the coin knows the Merkle path of this coin in some previous state. And there is some simple dispute resolution protocol for dispute - who is the owner of this coin - latest Merkle path to the state with this coin is the owner. And every user has incentives to keep his data and monitor L1. And participate in the dispute resolution protocol.

# Limitations

- indivisible notes: no UTXO splitting, no accounts
- no Turing-complete smart contracts (only bitcoin script is possible)
- interactive communication
- user should keep data and monitor L1

# NFT

Indivisible notes can be NFT. So it's perfect feet for NFT marketplaces and NFT games.

# Atomic transaction and atomic swaps

We can introduce an atomic transaction where 2 user exchanges a few indivisible notes. It's trivial.
