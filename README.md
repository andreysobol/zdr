# Zero Data Rollup

Zero Data Rollup: it's a protocol with rollup security properties and off-chain data availability. 

How can it possible?

We need to use interactive protocol where sender, receiver and operator should cooperate to make a transaction.

# How it works

We introduce a `coinId` concept from [Plasma Cash](https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-cash-plasma-with-much-less-per-user-data-checking/1298). Every ether inside our protocol is a note - note with indivisible unique `coinID` which can be transfered holistically. Other words it's UTXO model with 1 input and 1 output per transaction.

When user deposit coin - protocol create unique `coinId`. After that operator can send this note with `coinID` on L2 to reciver. Reciver should get merkle path of new state and sign the transaction. Otherwise transaction will create withdrawal with this `coinId` to L1.

So every owners and past owners of the coin know merkle path of this coin in some previus state. And there is some simple dispute resolution protocol for dispute - who is owner of this coin - latest merkle path to the state with this coin is owner. And every user have insentives to keep his data and monitor L1. And participate to the dispute resolution protocol.

# Limitations

- indivisible notes: no UTXO splitting, no accounts
- no turing complete smart contracts (only bitcoin script is possible)
- interactive communication
- user should keep data and monitor L1

# NFT

Indivisible notes can be NFT. So it's perfect feet for NFT marketplaces and NFT games.

# Atomic transaction and atomic swaps

We can introduce atomic transaction where 2 user exchange few indivisible notes. It's trivial.
